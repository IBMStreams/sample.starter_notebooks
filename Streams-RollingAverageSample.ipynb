    "We started with a `Stream` called `readings`, which contained the data we wanted to analyze. Next, we used functions in the `Stream` object to perform simple analysis and produced the `enriched_average` stream.  This stream is `published` for other applications running within our Streams instance to access.\n",
    "\n",
    "After submitting the application to the Streams service, we used the `enriched_average` view to see the results.\n",
